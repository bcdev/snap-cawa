CAWA
===========
(For requierements read  INSTALL) 


Scope
-----
CAWA cloud core is meant to be the core of a L1B --> L2 processor,
for the retrieval of oxygen cloud top pressure.
It is sensor independend, curently MERIS and OLCI 
look up tables are provided. It works for all pixel, 
however only cloudy pixel deliver sensible results.
The cloud optical thickness does not account for 
optical effective radius (missing SWIR Bands), thus 
it will not be accurate in particular close to cloud/rain 
bows.


There are two versions of the core processor:
a) 'Cloud_core'. A slim and faster version, only retrieving 
   cloud top pressure and cloud optical thickness. Use this for 
   MERIS

b) 'cloud_complete_core', the full version, additionally retrieving 
   cloud profile information. Use this for OLCI.



It needs:
 
+ normalized radiance (TOA radiance divided by solar constant) [sr-1]
  at the window and absorption bands 
+ surface pressure [hPa]
+ surface albedo around 750 nm. A examplarily climatology 
  is provided. (study the demo) 
+ ... see demo example.
+ the precise deviation of the central wavelength from the nominal
  (study the demo!!!)




##Satellite specifics
### MERIS
Needed Bands. 10(W), 11(A).  
The content of L1b (radiance) must be divided by the corresponding solar constant. 
It should be the precise solar constant respecting the real spectral position (using the detector index) and sun earth distance.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
In order to retrieve sensible values, it is necessary 
to preprocess Band 11 using 'stray_coeff_potenz4.nc'. 
Follow the procedure in the demo files!

### OLCI
Needed Bands. 12(W), 13(A), 14A), 15(A).  
The content of L1b (radiance) must be divided by the corresponding solar constant. 
It should be the precise solar constant respecting the real spectral position (using the detector index) and sun earth distance. Fortunately this 
is already part otf the L1B file.
